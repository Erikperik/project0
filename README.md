Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

This website is about gardening!

I have created one main (index) page and three pages abut trees, plants and soil.

All pages are accessable from each page via the header and navigation bar.

The navigation bar is made using tree Bootstrap columns. They stack when the window is too narrow.

Each page has one html-file. All pages share the stylesheets style.css and variables.css. Variables.css is made from variables.scss.

The page is centered with a margin (via the calss "centersite") on bot side to give a more modern look and to have plenty of space for all the commercials on the sides that will make me rich. ;)

The page does however go back to "full screen" when the width of the window is smaller than 1100 px (some sort of average phone screen), so that it will be easy to read and use on smaller screens.

Now please enjoy this masterpiece! :)
